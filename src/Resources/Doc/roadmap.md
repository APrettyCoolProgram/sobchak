# Sobchak: Roadmap

* Option: Create or verify
* Fix button colors so they interact better
* Show files when choosing a source
    * Don't show .sobchak/
* Update with what file is being worked on
* Maybe show file sizes so the user knows if a file will take a while?
* When verifying, create missing hashes
* Simplify verification text (i.e. "Invalid: file.name", Missing: file.name")
* Percentage starts at zero
* Ignore certain file name/extensions/sizes
