## Non-Archiwizator
* Fix button colors so they interact better
* Show files when choosing a source
    * Don't show .sobchak/
* Update with what file is being worked on
* Maybe show file sizes so the user knows if a file will take a while?
* Percentage starts at zero
* Ignore certain file name/extensions/sizes
* Auto verify recursively
* Auto create recursively


## Archiwizator
* Update SetupSobchak() to mirror the changes
* Use smaller version of the logo so other controls can go next to it?
